# TickTick OAuth Example

This is a basic example to perform OAuth in NodeJS with TickTick.

This app performs the steps outlined in the [TickTick OAuth Documentation](https://developer.ticktick.com/docs#/openapi).

## Prerequisites

- TickTick app created in the [TickTick Developer Portal](https://developer.ticktick.com/manage)
- TickTick Client ID and Client Secret.

## Setup

1. Clone this repository
1. Install dependencies with `npm install`
1. Create a `.env` file with the following contents:

```env
CLIENT_ID=<your client id>
CLIENT_SECRET=<your client secret>
```

4. Run the app with `npm start`

## Usage

1. Visit `http://localhost:3000/auth` in your browser. This will redirect you to TickTick to authorize the app.
1. After authorizing, you will be redirected back to the app. The console where you ran `npm start` will display your access token and refresh token, as well as the result of project call to TickTick.
